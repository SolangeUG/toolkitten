# Homework

Upload a single file named as `soc01hw-firstname-lastname.py`, with all exercises from **A Few Things to Try** sections.

If it says *Optional*, then the homework is of course optional, it is for those who would like more exercise,
or more advanced exercises.

## Day - 01

**Write a program that tells you the following:**
- Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
- Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
- Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.
- Andreea Visanoiu​: I'm 48618000 seconds old. Calculate Andreea Visanoiu's age.

**Here are some tougher questions:**
- How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?
- How about a 64-bit system?
- Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday).
You will need Python modules.

## Day - 03

**Full name greeting:**
- Write a program that asks for a person’s first name, then middle, and then last.
- Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.

**Bigger, better favorite number:**
- Write a program that asks for a person’s favorite number.
- Have your program add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. Do be tactful about it, though.

**Angry boss:**
- Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want.
- Whatever you answer, the angry boss should yell it back to you and then fire you. For example, if you type in I want a raise, it should yell back like this:
> WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!

**Table of contents:**
- Here’s something for you to do in order to play around more with `center`, `ljust`, and `rjust`.
- Write a program that will display a table of contents so that it looks like this:

````
          Table of Contents

Chapter 1: Getting Started        page 1

Chapter 2: Numbers                page 9

Chapter 3: Letters                page 13
